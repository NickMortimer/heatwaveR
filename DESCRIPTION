Title: Detect heatwaves and cold-spells
Description: This package is designed to include and encompass the different methods of defining and detecting extreme events, known as heatwaves or cold-spells in both air and water temperature data. These detection algorithms may be used on non-temperature data as well however, this is not catered for explicitly here as no use of this technique in the literature currently exists.
