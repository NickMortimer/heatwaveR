# heatwaveR

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/robwschlegel/heatwaveR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robwschlegel/heatwaveR)
[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/robwschlegel/heatwaveR/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/robwschlegel/heatwaveR?branch=master)

The __`heatwaveR`__ package is a project-wide update to the __`RmarineHeatWaves`__ package,
which is itself a translation of the original Python code written by Eric C. J. Oliver that 
can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves).

The __`heatwaveR`__  R package contains the original functions from the __`RmarineHeatWaves`__ 
package that calculate and display marine heatwaves (MHWs) according to the 
definition of Hobday et al. (2016) as well as calculating and visualising marine 
cold-spells (MCSs) as first introduced in Schlegel et al. (2017).

A new package was developed and released in order to better accommodate the inclusion of
the definitions of atmospheric heatwaves in addition to MHWs. Additionally, __`heatwaveR`__
also provides the first implementation of a definition for a 'compound heatwave'.
There are currently multiple different definitions for this type of event and each of which
has an algorithm provided for it in the output of the `detect()` function.

This package is not yet available on CRAN, but may be installed from GitHub 
by issuing the following command:

`devtools::install_github("robwschlegel/heatwaveR")`

# The functions

|Function             |Description|
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`detect()`           |The main function which detects the events as per the definition of Hobday et al. (2016).|
|`make_whole()`       |Constructs a continuous, uninterrupted time series of temperatures.|
|`block_average()`    |Calculates annual means for event metrics.|
|`event_line()`       |Creates a line plot of heatwaves or cold-spells.|
|`lolli_plot()`       |Creates a timeline of selected event metrics.|
|`exceedance()`       |A function similar to `detect()` but that detects consecutive days above/below a given static threshold.|
|`geom_flame()`       |Creates flame polygons of heatwaves or cold-spells.|
|`geom_lolli()`       |Creates a lolliplot timeline of selected event metric.|

The package also provides data of observed SST records for three historical MHWs: 
the 2011 Western Australia event, the 2012 Northwest Atlantic event and the 
2003 Mediterranean event.

## The detection and graphing functions

The `detect()` function is the package's core function. Here is the `detect()` function applied to the Western Australian test data,
which are also discussed by Hobday et al. (2016):

```{r detect-example1}
library(heatwaveR); library(dplyr); library(ggplot2)
ts <- make_whole(sst_WA)
mhw <- detect(ts, climatology_start = 1983, climatology_end = 2012)
mhw$event %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(event_no, duration, date_start, date_peak, int_mean, int_max, int_cum) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(-int_cum) %>% 
  head(5)
```

The corresponding `event_line()` and `lolli_plot()`, which represent the massive Western Australian heatwave of 2011, look like this:

```{r fig-example1, eval=FALSE}
event_line(mhw, spread = 200, metric = "int_cum",
           start_date = "2010-10-01", end_date = "2011-08-30")
```

![](docs/fig-example1-1.png)

```{r fig-example2, eval=FALSE}
lolli_plot(mhw)
```

![](docs/fig-example2-1.png)

The `event_line()` and `lolli_plot()` functions were designed to work directly on one of the dataframes in the list returned by `detect()`. If more control over the figures is required, it may be useful to create them in **`ggplot2`** by stacking `geoms`. We specifically created two new **`ggplot2`** `geoms` to reproduce the functionality of `event_line()` and `lolli_plot()`. These functions are more general in their functionality and can be used outside of the **`heatwaveR`** package too. To apply them to MHWs and MCSs first requires that we access the `clim` or `event` dataframes within the list that is produced by `detect()`. Here is how:

```{r fig-example3, eval=FALSE}
mhw2 <- mhw$clim %>% 
  slice(10580:10690) # select the region of the time series of interest

ggplot(mhw2, aes(x = t, y = temp, y2 = thresh_clim_year)) +
  geom_flame() +
  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date("2011-02-26"), y = 25.8, label = "the Destroyer\nof Kelps"))

ggplot(mhw$event, aes(x = date_start, y = int_max)) +
  geom_lolli(colour = "salmon", colour.n = "red", n = 3) +
  geom_text(colour = "black", aes(x = as.Date("2006-08-01"), y = 5,
                label = "The marine heatwaves\nTend to be left skewed in a\nGiven time series"))
```
![](docs/fig-example3-1.png)
![](docs/fig-example3-2.png)

The default output of these function may not be to your liking. If so, not to worry. As **`ggplot2`** `geoms`, they are highly malleable. For example, if we were to choose to reproduce the format of the MHWs as seen in Hobday et al. (2016), the code would look something like this:

```{r fig-example4, eval=FALSE}
# It is necessary to give geom_flame() at least one row on either side of the event in order to calculate the polygon corners smoothly
mhw_top <- mhw2 %>% 
  slice(49:110)

ggplot(data = mhw2, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y = temp, y2 = thresh_clim_year, fill = "all"), show.legend = T) +
  geom_flame(data = mhw_top, aes(y = temp, y2 = thresh_clim_year, fill = "top"), show.legend = T) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, colour = "temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh_clim_year, colour = "thresh"), size = 1.0) +
  geom_line(aes(y = seas_clim_year, colour = "seas"), size = 1.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Line Colour",
                      values = c("temp" = "black", "thresh" =  "forestgreen", "seas" = "grey80")) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Event Colour", values = c("all" = "salmon", "top" = "red")) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%b") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = NA))) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")))
```

![](docs/fig-example4-1.png)

Should we not wish to highlight any events with `geom_lolli()`, it would look like this:

```{r fig-example5, eval=FALSE}
# Note that this is accomplished by setting 'colour.n = NA', not by setting 'n = 0'.
ggplot(mhw$event, aes(x = date_start, y = int_cum)) +
  geom_lolli(colour = "salmon", n = 3, colour.n = NA)
```

![](docs/fig-example5-1.png)

The calculation and visualisation of cold-spells is also accommodated within this package. Here is a cold spell detected in the OISST data for Western Australia:

```{r detect-example2}
mcs <- detect(ts, climatology_start = 1983, climatology_end = 2012, cold_spells = TRUE)
mcs$event %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(event_no, duration, date_start, date_peak, int_mean, int_max, int_cum) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(int_cum) %>% 
  head(5)
```

The plots showing the cold-spells look like this:

```{r fig-example6, eval=FALSE}
# this function needs to be updated as it currently only works when 't' is the column name for date
event_line(mcs, spread = 200, metric = "int_cum",
           start_date = "1990-01-01", end_date = "1990-08-30")

lolli_plot(mcs)
```

![](docs/fig-example6-1.png)
![](docs/fig-example6-2.png)

Cold spell figures may be created as `geoms` in **`ggplot2`**, too:

```{r fig-example7, eval=FALSE}
mcs2 <- mcs$clim %>% 
  slice(2990:3190)

# # Note that the plot centres on the polygons, so it may be necessary to manually zoom out a bit
ggplot(data = mcs2, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y = thresh_clim_year, y2 = temp), fill = "steelblue3", show.legend = F) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, colour = "temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh_clim_year, colour = "thresh"), size = 1.0) +
  geom_line(aes(y = seas_clim_year, colour = "seas"), size = 1.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Line Colour",
                      values = c("temp" = "black", "thresh" =  "forestgreen", "seas" = "grey80")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(18, 23.5)) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%b") +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")))

ggplot(mcs$event, aes(x = date_start, y = int_cum)) +
  geom_lolli(colour = "steelblue3", colour.n = "navy", n = 7) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(expression(paste("Cumulative intensity [days x ", degree, "C]")))
```

![](docs/fig-example7-1.png)
![](docs/fig-example7-2.png)

## The exceedance function

In addition to the calculation of extreme events, consecutive days over a given static threshold may be calculated with the `exceedance()` function.

```{r exceedance-example1}
exc_25 <- exceedance(ts, threshold = 25)
exc_25$exceedance %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(exceedance_no, duration, date_start, date_peak, int_mean, int_cum) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-int_cum) %>%
  head(5)
```

Which, when plotted with __`ggplot2`__ code would look like this:

```{r fig-example8, eval=FALSE}
exc_25_thresh <- exc_25$threshold %>% 
  slice(9500:9866)

ggplot(data = exc_25_thresh, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y = temp, y2 = thresh, fill = "all"), show.legend = F) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, colour = "temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh, colour = "thresh"), size = 1.0) +
  # geom_line(aes(y = seas_clim_year, colour = "seas"), size = 1.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Line Colour",
                      values = c("temp" = "black", "thresh" =  "forestgreen")) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Event Colour", values = c("all" = "salmon")) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%b") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = NA))) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")))
```

![](docs/fig-example8-1.png)

The same function may be used to calculate consecutive days below a threshold, too.

```{r exceedance-example2}
exc_19 <- exceedance(ts, threshold = 19, below = TRUE)
exc_19$exceedance %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(exceedance_no, duration, date_start, date_peak, int_mean, int_cum) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(int_cum) %>%
  head(5)
```

And were one to desire a visualisation of these data it could be produced with the following code:

```{r fig-example9, eval=FALSE}
exc_19_thresh <- exc_19$threshold %>% 
  slice(1500:1866)

ggplot(data = exc_19_thresh, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y = thresh, y2 = temp), fill = "steelblue3", show.legend = F) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, colour = "temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh, colour = "thresh"), size = 1.0) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Line Colour",
                      values = c("temp" = "black", "thresh" =  "forestgreen")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(18, 23.5)) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%b") +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")))
```

# Working with gridded SST data

We can also load the gridded 0.25 degree Reynolds [OISST data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/thredds/blended-global/oisst-catalog.html) and apply the function pixel by pixel over all of the days of data. The example data used here have 93 longitude steps, 43 latitude steps, and cover 12797 days (1981 to 2016). We apply the `detect()` function to these data, fit a generalised linear model (GLM), and then plot the trend per decade of the marine heatwave count. In other words, have marine heatwaves become more or less frequent in recent years? Under climate change we can expect that extreme events would tend to occur more frequently and be of greater intensity. Indeed, we can clearly see in the figure below of the result of the GLM, how the Agulhas Current has been experiencing marine heatwaves more frequently in recent decades. But there are two smaller areas, one along the western side of the Cape Peninsula in the Benguela Upwelling system and another around the Eastern Cape Province near Algoa Bay, where the frequency of marine heatwaves seems to have actually been decreasing -- although the *P*-value of the decreasing trend is > 0.05, and therefore not significant.

Please read the package [vignette](https://github.com/ajsmit/RmarineHeatWaves/blob/master/vignettes/gridded-event-detection.Rmd) to see how to load a netCDF file with the OISST data, apply the `detect()` function to the whole 3D array of data, and then fit the GLM and plot the data.
