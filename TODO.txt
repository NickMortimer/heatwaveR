TODO

* add weighted average smoother
* add smoother based on median (as an alternative to the default mean)
* distinction between baselines and climatologies (currently a climatology is calculated by default, and there is now an option to add an independent baseline); there should be added an option to provide a 365-day (or 366...how to handle leap years?) long daily climatology that had been independently calculated as a custom climatology against which the events can be detected. In order to understand how this works, I need to properly define what I mean by baseline and climatology as they are different things in my mind...
* more climatology and baseline options
* output option: summary statistics of built-in climatology
* output option: summary plot of built-in climatology
* define events and climatologies as S3 classes
* maybe change the names 'smooth_percentile_width' and 'smooth_percentile' as they actually have nothing to do with percentiles; in the documentation, make clear how the new names used relate back to the same (but differently named) arguments in the python code
* Add category metric for 'size' of heatwave
* Add block_average metric() 'intensity_max_max'
* Possibly create a mhw_block() function
* If so, also give it a qualitative score as in the python version
