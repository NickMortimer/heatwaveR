* add weighted average smoother
* add smoother based on median (as an alternative to the default mean)
* distinction between baselines and climatologies (currently a climatology is calculated by default, and there is now an option to add an independent baseline); there should be added an option to provide a 365-day (or 366...how to handle leap years?) long daily climatology that had been independently calculated as a custom climatology against which the events can be detected. In order to understand how this works, I need to properly define what I mean by baseline and climatology as they are different things in my mind...
* more climatology and baseline options
* output option: summary statistics of built-in climatology
* output option: summary plot of built-in climatology
* define events and climatologies as S3 classes
* maybe change the names 'smooth_percentile_width' and 'smooth_percentile' as they actually have nothing to do with percentiles; in the documentation, make clear how the new names used relate back to the same (but differently named) arguments in the python code
* Add category metric for 'size' of heatwave
* Add block_average metric() 'intensity_max_max'
* Possibly create a mhw_block() function
* If so, also give it a qualitative score as in the python version
* Possible compound hw qualities from Baldwin et al. (in review)
** 1) a minimum number of hot days occurring consecutively to start a heat wave
** 2) a maximum number of cooler (below threshold) days that can occur consecutively for the heat wave to continue
** 3) a minimum number of hot days occurring consecutively that can add onto a heat wave after a break
** For quick reference, we denote a temporal structure definition with three numbers, for example 321 where 3 indicates a minimum initial event
length of three hot days, 2 indicates a maximum break length of two cooler days, and 1 indicates a minimum length of a set of consecutive hot days that can compound on after a break.
** The quantity of interest here is the cumulative annual compound days as a proportion of total heat wave days (hereafter “compound proportion”).
** Once the mean signal in a time series begins to raise, this proportion will increase, to a point
** It will then deminish down to zero as every day becomes greter than the 90th percentile threshold
